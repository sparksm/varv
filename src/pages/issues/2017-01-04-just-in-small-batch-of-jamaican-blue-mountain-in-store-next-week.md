For years now, the amount of feral cats throughout the city of Richmond has been a huge problem. There are multiple trap, neuter, release (TNR) groups throughout the city, however the feral cat population is still an issue, largely due to the funding needed to keep these operations running. It is not irregular to see hungry cats showing up in residents' yards, breeding by people's homes, and unfortunately, seeing their bodies in the streets. These issues break the hearts of cat lovers, and annoy those who aren't fond of cats. However, both groups want a solution. By providing city funding to established TNR programs, or by implementing one through Richmond Animal Control, the feral cat population can be humanely controlled to reasonable amount.
