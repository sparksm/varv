Our children in grades K-12 are the individuals who will be most affected by the current climate crisis. In order to curb these impacts, one of the leading causes must be addressed: meat consumption. Providing healthy, plant-based meals for Richmond students once a week will not only raise immense awareness for animal agriculture's role inÂ climate change, but it will also make a huge difference in lowering the amount of greenhouse gases being emitted into the atmosphere. In addition, consuming excessive amounts of animal derived foods have been linked to health problems such as childhood obesity, high cholesterol and type 2 diabetes. Countless schools throughout the world have already successfully implemented Meatless Monday programs and it would be an excellent way for Richmond to improve the health of the city's children as well as the environment.
